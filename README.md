Pee Pal
==============

All people should be able to be comfortable doing something we all do- use the bathroom. Pee Pal was made to help people find gender neutral restrooms, handicap accessible restrooms, family friendly restrooms, and restrooms with baby changing stations. Users can view restrooms near them, search restrooms by tags, view our catalog of bathrooms, and add a bathroom that is not on the app by taking a picture and/or dropping a map marker.

This app is currently being developed on Android with a Parse backend. We are targetting university facilities at the moment, but hope to expand by including as many public restrooms as possible. Pee Pal is still a work in progress.
